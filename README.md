# TNM084-Project
A procedural sound visualizer that takes the frequency and amplitude data of a .wav file and visualizes it using procedural graphics. The visualization is done using flow noise and sine waves. PyOpenGL was used for rendering, librosa was used for audio analysis and Pygame for playing the sound. Flow noise implementation taken from https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MstXWn and slightly modified. Author: Ruben Brom√©e.
